        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Differential privacy (DP) is a technique for preserving individual
          privacy. It does this by adding controllable noise to the data so that
          one person's data does not change the output significantly, making it
          harder for attackers to gain information.
          <br />
          <br />
          Central differential privacy is a type of DP that is already widely
          used, its application is mostly on the server/host/creator side with
          raw data. For example, after raw data is collected from clients, DP is
          applied to ensure that the data is good and privacy-preserved for
          internal and external use.
          <br />
          <br />
          Local differential privacy (LDP) on the other hand, is less common.
          LDP is applied on the client side before reaching the server, ensuring
          the data given is "accurate" enough to be useful while also preserving
          some privacy. For example, instead of the data being sent directly to
          the server, noise is added before it does, ensuring that individual
          privacy is preserved when it is used by a third party.
          <br />
          <br />
          LDP could provide more privacy for everyone if it was adapted more.
          Since it is applied on the client before data is sent to servers, no
          raw data is collected by a 3rd party. When things like data-breaches
          happen, individual privacy is preserved, and it will be harder for
          attackers to isolate a single person's data. The trade-off for using
          LDP is accuracy, but it might be worth it if everyone's privacy is
          preserved.
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal of this website is to spread awareness towards LDP with a
          detailed showcase with the hopes that it gets adapted more in
          practical scenarios, leading to more privacy for everyone overall.

        <h2>Showcase #1 - Laplace + Numbers</h2>
        <p>
          For the first showcase, we'll cover something simple. We start with
          raw numbers, add noise to it, and then send it to the server for
          analysis. We can pretend that we're working with a dataset of user's
          ages. Since Age is a whole number and usually within range of 1-100,
          our simulated data will use this fact:
          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/1 SimulatedData.png"
            class="border border-white"
            alt="Using a for loop to add random numbers from 1-99."
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we setup a simple socket for client/server communication and a
          output window it's easier to tell what the server sees. When the
          server receives data from the client, it'll output analysis data
          (Range, Median, and Mode) on the dataset of numbers.
          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/
2 ServerOut.png"
            class="border border-primary"
            alt="Server Output window"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now onto the client, The basic idea is that raw data is given, noise
          is added using the Laplace mechanism as DP and is then sent to the
          server.
          <br />
          <br />
          We wanted the demo to be a bit interactive, so we let the client
          specify the epsilon value. After setting up the client socket, we ask
          for an epsilon value and loop for raw data input.

            class="border border-white"
            alt="CLI client with example numbers for epsilon and data"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          And here is the laplace function:

          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/
4 LaplaceCall.png"
            class="border border-white"
            alt="Laplace function call"
          />
          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/
5 LaplaceFunct.png"
            class="border border-white"
            alt="Laplace function body"
          />
          Our sensitivy is 99 here because it's the maximum the data can change
          by (accounts for worst-case). Age is usually also a whole number so we
          round the final result with int().
        </p>
        <p>
          After adding noise, the data is sent to the server and the server demo
          will update it's analysis;
          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/
6 Running Demo.png"
            class="border border-white"
            alt="client/server demo"
            data-bs-toggle="tooltip"
            data-bs-placement="right"
            title="pay attention now...."
          />
          In the above Image, The CLI interface represents the client, and the
          white window is what the server sees.
        </p>
        <p>
          With enough data-points, the server will have a pretty accurate
          measure of the shape and distribution of the data. As an example,
          here's the result of running the same epsilon = 2 and data = 24 500+
          times, It gets closer to 24 with each new data-point;

        <p>Here's some more tests, as scatter graphs,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The first test is done with epsilon 10, age 22+noise sent 200 times.
          </li>
          <li>
            The 2nd test is done with epsilon 25, age 22+noise sent 200 times.
          </li>

          Showcase #2 - Different mechanisms and Images (Demo program by Hong)
        </h2>
        <p>
          For showcase 2, we have a simple webapp where we can specify from one
          of three mechanisms, input an epsilon value, a sensitivity value, a
          input value, and a point value. As the epsilon value increases the
          noise generated becomes more accurate to the value input.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the context of LDP, different mechanisms have different pros and
          cons. But overall, accuracy is the trade-off compared to a centralized
          implementation. For our example, Laplace and Gaussian is best for
          numerical values and exponential is best for a smaller finite set.

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          This demo also includes adding noise to an image,
          <img
            src="https://wtpsu.github.io/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project/media/
12 Hong image Original"
            class="border border-primary"

13 Hong image Noise"
            class="border border-primary"
            alt="Webapp image demo after noise added"
          />
          In the context of LDP, this noisy image would be sent to a server,
          which then could be used for things like simple classification or
          recognition, color distribution estimates, similarity comparison,
          pattern matching, trends, training models and more.
