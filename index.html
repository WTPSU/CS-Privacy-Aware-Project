      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Differential privacy (DP) is a technique for preserving individual
        privacy. It does this by adding controllable noise to the data so that
        one person's data does not change the output significantly, making it
        harder for attackers to gain information.
        <br />
        <br />
        Central differential privacy is a type of DP that is already widely
        used, its application is mostly on the server/host/creator side with raw
        data. For example, after raw data is collected from clients, DP is
        applied to ensure that the data is good and privacy-preserved for
        internal and external use.
        <br />
        <br />
        Local differential privacy (LDP) on the other hand, is less common. LDP
        is applied on the client side before reaching the server, ensuring the
        data given is "accurate" enough to be useful while also preserving some
        privacy. For example, instead of the data being sent directly to the
        server, noise is added before it does, ensuring that individual privacy
        is preserved when it is used by a third party.
        <br />
        <br />
        LDP could provide more privacy for everyone if it was adapted more.
        Since it is applied on the client before data is sent to servers, no raw
        data is collected by a 3rd party. When things like data-breaches happen,
        individual privacy is preserved, and it will be harder for attackers to
        isolate a single person's data. The trade-off for using LDP is accuracy,
        but it might be worth it if everyone's privacy is preserved.
        <br />
        <br />
        The goal of this website is to spread awareness towards LDP with a
        detailed showcase with the hopes that it gets adapted more in practical
        scenarios, leading to more privacy for everyone overall.

        The showcase source(s) can be found and ran at our
        <a href="https://github.com/WTPSU/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project">

      <h2>Showcase #1 - Laplace + Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        For the first showcase, we'll cover something simple. We start with raw
        numbers, add noise to it, and then send it to the server for analysis.
        We can pretend that we're working with a dataset of user's ages. Since
        Age is a whole number and usually within range of 1-100, our simulated
        data will use this fact:
        <img

          alt="Using a for loop to add random numbers from 1-99."
        />

        Next we setup a simple socket for client/server communication and a
        output window it's easier to tell what the server sees. When the server
        receives data from the client, it'll output analysis data (Range,
        Median, and Mode) on the dataset of numbers.

          alt="Server Output window"
        />

        Now onto the client, The basic idea is that raw data is given, noise is
        added using the Laplace mechanism as DP and is then sent to the server.
        <br />
        <br />
        We wanted the demo to be a bit interactive, so we let the client specify
        the epsilon value. After setting up the client socket, we ask for an
        epsilon value and loop for raw data input.

          alt="CLI client with example numbers for epsilon and data"
        />

        And here is the laplace function:

          alt="Laplace function call"
        />

5 LaplaceFunct.png"
          alt="Laplace function body"
        />

        Our sensitivy is 99 here because it's the maximum the data can change by
        (accounts for worst-case). Age is usually also a whole number so we
        round the final result with int().
        <br />
        <br />
        After adding noise, the data is sent to the server and the server demo
        will update it's analysis;

          alt="client/server demo"
        />

        With enough data-points, the server will have a pretty accurate measure
        of the shape and distribution of the data. As an example, here's the
        result of running the same epsilon = 2 and data = 24 500+ times, It gets
        closer to 24 with each new data-point;

      </p>
      <p>Here's some more tests, as scatter graphs,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first test is done with epsilon 10, age 22+noise sent 200 times.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 2nd test is done with epsilon 25, age 22+noise sent 200 times.
        </li>
      </ul>
