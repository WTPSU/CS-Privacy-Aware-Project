      <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Differential privacy (DP) is a technique for preserving individual
        privacy. It does this by adding controllable noise to the data so that
        one person's data does not change the output significantly, making it
        harder for attackers to gain information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Central differential privacy is a type of DP that is already widely
        used, Its application is mostly on the server/host/creator side with raw
        data. Local differential privacy (LDP) on the other hand, is less common
        and could provide more privacy if it was widely adapted more. LDP is
        applied on the client side before reaching the server, ensuring the data
        given is "accurate" enough to be useful while also preserving some
        privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this website is to spread awareness of LDP with a detailed
        showcase with the hopes that it gets adapted more in practical
        scenarios. We'll first start with raw data, add noise to it, and then
        send it to the server for analysis. The showcase source can be found and
        ran at our
        <a href="https://github.com/WTPSU/CS-Privacy-Aware-Project">
          repo on Github.

      <h2>The showcase</h2>
      <p>
        We'll first start with showcasing something simple, like numbers. We can
        pretend that we're working with a dataset with user's ages. Since Age is
        a whole number and usually within range of 1-100, our simulated data
        will use this fact:

      />
      <p>
        Next we setup a simple socket for client/server communication and a
        output window it's easier to tell what the server sees. When the server
        receives data from the client, it'll output analysis data (Range,
        Median, and Mode) on the dataset of numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now onto the client, The basic idea is that raw data is given, noise is
        added using the Laplace mechanism as DP and is then sent to the server.
        We wanted the demo to be a bit interactive, so we let the client specify
        the epsilon value. After setting up the client socket, we ask for an
        epsilon value and loop for raw data input.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/3 Client CLI.png"
        alt="CLI client with example numbers for epsilon and data"
      />
      <p>And here is the laplace function:</p>

      <img src="../images/5 LaplaceFunct.png" alt="Laplace function" />
      <p>
        Our sensitivy is 99 here because it's the maximum the data can change by
        (accounts for worst-case). Age is usually also a whole number so we
        round the final result with int().
      </p>
      <p>
        After adding noise, the data is sent to the server and the server demo
        will update it's analysis;
      </p>

      <p>
        With enough data-points, the server will have a pretty accurate measure
        of the shape and distribution of the data. As an example, here's the
        result of running the same epsilon = 2 and data = 24 500+ times, It gets
        closer to 24 with each new data-point;
